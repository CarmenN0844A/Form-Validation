 File Validation Form A simple and customizable file validation form for web applications. This form allows users to upload files, with real-time validation based on file type, file size, and custom rules. It ensures that only valid files are accepted, providing immediate feedback to users. Features File Type Validation: Restrict uploads to specific file types (e.g., images, documents). File Size Limitation: Enforce a maximum file size for uploaded files. Custom Validation Rules: Add additional validation such as filename pattern checks or virus scanning. Real-time User Feedback: Provides error messages when the file doesn't meet the validation criteria. Multiple File Uploads: Users can upload more than one file at a time.

Usage File Upload: The form allows users to select files via the file input field or drag-and-drop. Validation: As soon as a file is selected, the form checks: File Type: If the file is of an allowed type (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, etc.). File Size: If the file is within the defined size limit (e.g., 10MB). Error Handling: If the file fails validation, an error message will appear next to the input field. Submit the Form: Once all files are valid, the user can submit the form. Example HTML html Copy code <form id="file-upload-form" enctype="multipart/form-data"> <label for="file-input">Upload File:</label> <input type="file" id="file-input" name="file" multiple> <div id="error-message"></div> <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form> Example JavaScript (Validation) javascript Copy code document.getElementById('file-upload-form').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); const fileInput = document.getElementById('file-input'); const file = fileInput.files[0]; const errorMessage = document.getElementById('error-message'); // Validate file type const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf', 'text/plain']; if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) { errorMessage.textContent = 'Invalid file type. Please upload an image or document.'; return; } // Validate file size (max 10 MB) if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {  // 10 MB limit errorMessage.textContent = 'File is too large. Maximum size is 10 MB.'; return; } // If validation passes, submit the form or process the file errorMessage.textContent = '';  // Clear any previous error messages console.log('File is valid:', file); }); Customization You can easily customize the form to suit your specific needs. Here are some ways you can modify the validation: Change allowed file types: Update the allowedTypes array in the JavaScript code to add or remove file types. Adjust file size limit: Modify the if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) condition to set a different file size limit (in bytes). Add custom validation: Implement additional checks, such as regex for filename patterns or integrating a virus scanning service. Contributing We welcome contributions to this project!
